# magento_test_task3
You need to -
1. Remove 2 random fields from the Shipping step;
2. All other field names, which should be written vice versa, like Name, should be emaN.
3. And the next step button should redirect back to the cart.

Please document all your changes for step 1. So we will know what was removed.

You can use any Magento 2 installation that you have.
Please also attach the documented installation process and the user with general explanations.
So we will be super sure to understand them correctly.
